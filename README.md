# Stroke Predict
This notebook presents a stroke prediction model using a dataset available in Kaggle. The dataset contains information about a variety of patients, including characteristics such as age, gender, smoking status, medical history, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis was taken from Kaggle, an online data science platform that offers public and private datasets, as well as tools for data analysis and modeling. The specific dataset used in this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset.

## Data preparation
Before creating the stroke prediction model, the data was pre-processed and prepared for training. Some of the data preparation steps include:

- Cleaning of missing data and outliers
- Coding of categorical features
- Data normalization
- Stroke prediction model
To predict whether a patient will have a stroke or not, a logistic regression model was used. The model was trained using patient characteristics as the independent variable and stroke status as the dependent variable.

The model was evaluated using precision and the confusion matrix. The results showed that the model was 95% accurate and was able to accurately predict whether a patient will have a stroke or not.

## Conclusion
This notebook presented a stroke prediction model using a dataset available in Kaggle. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine model was able to accurately predict whether a patient will have a stroke or not based on their characteristics. Stroke prediction can be useful for clinicians and healthcare professionals who want to identify patients at increased stroke risk and take preventive measures to reduce that risk.
